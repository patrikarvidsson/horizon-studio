## SSRS is the Swedish Sea Rescue Society.

The Swedish Sea Rescue Society is involved in close to 80% of all sea rescue
missions in Sweden, and receives no government funding for their effort. The
Society is financed by membership fees, donations and voluntary work.

Thanks to over 2.000 volunteer crew members, rescue services are available 24
hours a day anywhere along the Swedish coast and on the major lakes. The
volunteers work as carpenters, doctors, fishermen, salesmen, plubers, teachers
and many other occupations. They are willing to go out in any weather, at any
time, for your safety.

The SSRS has more than 119.000 members all around Sweden.

I worked together with the Swedish design and development agency
[Kodamera](https://www.kodamera.se/) to improve and launch a new weather prediction application.
