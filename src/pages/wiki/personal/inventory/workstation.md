# Workstation

I'm doing the majority of my work on a Macbook Pro, and I lean towards running a linux-flavoured OS as much as possible.

In my process I use a variety of different tools and applications. I choose open source and minimalistic tools as often as possible.

- [Figma](https://figma.com) — design application
- [Brave](https://brave.com/) — web browser
- [doom-emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) — editor
- [vim](https://www.vim.org/) — terminal editor
- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) — shell
