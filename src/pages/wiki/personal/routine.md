## Notes on routine and habits.

I usually start the day around 5 am and try to prioritize 60 minutes of exercise the first thing I do each morning. This is followed by a review of the list of tasks which was created the evening before.

Mornings are most productive for me and I know from experience that I'm able to have 2 or 3 hours of uninterrupted productive time, which are divided into [pomodoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) of 25 minutes each.

During these deep work sessions I avoid any social networking platforms, including e-mail, to fully immerse myself in the task I want to have achieved.

Working in a start-up culture requires me to regularly coordinate with other departments so the rest of the day is usually a mix between meetings, administrative work or ad-hoc work sessions whenever possible.

In the evening I try to research topics that interests me in an effort to expand my knowledge, and gain inspiration for the next day.

Before I go to bed I make a habit of journaling any new knowledge gained from today and log productive time. I use the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method to catalog this knowledge, and [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) as the writing tool for it. I end the day by writing a list of tasks I wish to have accomplished for the next day.
