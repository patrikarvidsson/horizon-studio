The game matches included game developers, online celebrities, competitive players and randomly picked players from the fan community.

Since its creation, the organization was able to gradually include more
well-known players in the matches and increased its publicity with each event.
The fourth event had one **million views** and raised approximately **14,500 USD for charity**, starring players like Notch, Yogscast, Freddie Wong, and developers from Valve Corporation and Bethesda Game Studios. Donations were given unshortened to a charity at each event.

The organization is no longer active but previous events are still available online for archival purposes.
