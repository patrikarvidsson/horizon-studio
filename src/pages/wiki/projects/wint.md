## Wint allows business owners to focus on other things than accounting paperwork.

![Support](/static/wint/design-hero.jpg)

I started using Wint in my company as I wanted to have an automated accounting process where I would spend less time on paperwork. In an attempt to learn more about the service and how its approach differs from traditional accounting solutions, I spent some time giving the service an updated design.

### An improved dashboard overview

Improving the design language, creating a design system and aligning elements better makes huge improvements in the perceived usability of a service. Things must feel connected, and all exit points (e.g. support) need to be easy for the customer to find and reach.

Previously it felt as if Wint tried to show as much information as possible without any visual hierarchy in the interface. After having used the service for a while you get used to how you'd need to navigate around but we shouldn't give our users unnecessary pain.

**The side-menu** is no longer a drawer (as it does not need to be), which also removes the awkwardly positioned menu button. By doing this we improve the overall feel of the service. We could keep this menu expandable, but then we would need to find a better position for the menu button.

**To-do** is a central part of the service, so to expose this further I added it to the side-menu and made it more prominent on the dashboard. The button calls for your attention through a red notification bubble. I also made it clearer which section you are currently viewing by marking it in blue.

**The user profile** is placed in the bottom section of the side-menu for the time being.

The button to contact **support** is now more visible. It still opens a modal window, but is more in tune with the design language of the dashboard and service itself.

### Better overview of invoices and customers

These two screens are inspired by similar services for sending invoices to give an overview of sent, paid and unpaid invoices that one would need to take action on. The customers screen shows statistics of each customer.
