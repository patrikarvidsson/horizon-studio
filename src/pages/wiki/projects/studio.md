## Studio is a complement to [this website](/projects/horizon) which lists commercial projects, in a portfolio setting.

It is a lightweight website built with NextJS and a few additional packages, hosted on Vercel. This project is still under development and is subject to change.

You can see the website in action [here](https://studio.patrikarvidsson.com) or review the code at [github](https://github.com/patrikarvidsson/horizon-studio).
