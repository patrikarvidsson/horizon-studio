## Design Thinking promotes problem-solving by giving us a hands-on, user-centric mindset that leads to innovation.

It is not a new way of thinking; as designers have applied human-centered creative processes in order of building meaningful and effective solutions for ages.

Even though this is the reality, design has for a long time been an afterthought in the business landscape. The current, and historical, application of design and design processes have resulted in products which fail to meet customers' real needs.

The design thinking framework helps us understand, explore and materialize our users needs by dividing the process into 6 phases — empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test and implement.

These phases can be iterated, and it is encouraged to do so. It is recommended to do the same exercise multiple times with different team members in order to reach something that is tangible. The outcome of each phase should be sound enough to serve as a guiding principle throughout the rest of the process and to ensure that you never stray too far from your focus.

### Empathize

During the empathize phase we conduct research in order to develop knowledge about what users are saying, doing and feeling. We talk to actual real life users, to observe what they do and how they feel, to find out what motivates or discourages them.

We need to build a solid foundation in order to empathize with our users and be able to understand their perspective.

### Define

When we define where our users problems and pain points exist we can also discover opportunities for innovation. Where do current user stories fail with in terms of the business goals? Is it possible to group certain users into common personas?

### Ideate

Address the users needs which were identified in the define phase. Explore crazy ideas and sketch out user stories.

Invite co-workers from other departments, especially non-designers, to participate in the ideation process. Diversity is key, and everyone should be encouraged to propose ideas without feeling left out or become ridiculed.

It is also important to not work in isolation. Share, learn, discuss and iterate the ideas as a group as a subset of the ideas should be brought in to the prototyping phase.

### Prototype

In the prototype phase, the impact is weighted against the feasibility of the project. The goal here is to understand which components work, and which do not.

The ideas should be transformed into real and tactile representations. Create wireframes and interactable prototypes to gain feedback internally. Then change it, review it, and gather additional feedback internally. There is no limit to what tools are used here, as long as it the iterations are quick. If you can best visualize this phase with code, then you should write code.

### Implement

The implementation phase is the most important phase which materializes the prototyped solution. Without it, we don't have a working end product and the whole process is made irrelevant.

Design thinking does not free you from actual design doing, and as impactful it can be for an organization it only leads to true innovation if and when the vision is successfully executed. The success for design thinking thus lies within its ability to transform the targeted aspect of the end user's life.
