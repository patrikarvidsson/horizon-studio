## A Design System is a single source of truth which groups all elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product efficiently.

A set of deliverables intended to keep evolving with the product, the tools and the new technologies.

At the most simple level, it is a collection of components with a set of rules and standards which guides the user. It is made of tangible elements such as colors and font, as well as intangible ones like best practices or unique brand values.

This collection is scalable, consistent, efficient and promotes productivity within and across teams.

At a more complex level, it is also an entity which details all design guidelines and processes within a product or across multiple products within a company. It empowers developers, strengthens the collaboration across teams and centralizes knowledge. It answers questions such as how and why, and provides a solid foundation to fall back on when needed.

> “When a technology matures, design moves to the foreground because the underlying machinery has been commoditized.”
- — John Maeda, Design in Tech Report

Creating a Design System is easy once you have decided to get started, but maintainting one and establishing it as the single source of truth is difficult. This process, however, is essential for any company that intends on succeeding.
