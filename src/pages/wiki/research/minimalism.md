## Minimalism is about finding simplicity and mindfulness in the daily chaos of our lives.

Minimalism is a paradigm shift which forces people to think, perceive and behave with new direction in a world voiced by unnecessary consumption, recession and enironmental degredation.

- — Marie Kondō

Designers should aim to reduce the noise and focus on solving actual user problems instead of creating beautiful interfaces that lacks usability. Users are visiting a website for its content and everything else just rests in the background. An overload of unnecessary design is thus equal to an overload of information pollution, and the world does not need more pollution.

[Horizon](/work/horizon) is built with minimalism in mind. It doesn't contain or require things such as tracking tools, unnecessary code or fancy effects. It is there to serve a purpose, and to document a designer's professional life.
