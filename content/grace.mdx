## Grace is a fintech startup which aims to disrupt an exhausted consumer credit market.

By giving users access to their income in advance, free from any interest rate, users are able to 'flex' their finances in a way that doesn't put them in a debt cycle.

With their service, Grace hope to eliminate the need for people to take small payday loans or overdrafts with often high interest rates and hidden fees.
