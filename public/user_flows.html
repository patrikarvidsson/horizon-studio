It includes the origin and termination points, individual steps, decision points, interaction points and&nbsp;more.</p><p>They help determine how many screens that are needed, what order they should appear in and what components need to be present to complete the&nbsp;task.</p><p>User flows are part of your final deliverables and help stakeholders understand the value of the idea and further how it affect the users though process and actions. The intention is create a foundation which you can revisit at a later point, either to change or complement as new data is&nbsp;accumulated.</p><p>A user journey is not a user flow. User journeys are more high level, should be done in a workshop with the entire product team, and illustrates one user&rsquo;s journey through your product. It touches on key stages, user goals, screens, pain points, insights, and ideas. Comparatively, user flows are primarily used to illustrate new features and ideas which goes into task&nbsp;breakdown.</p><h3>Use real&nbsp;data</h3><p>Solid research should be done prior to creating user flows. You need to understand the pain points you are solving or solution you are&nbsp;providing.</p><p>Once you know this you can begin map out the user flows. Start at a high-level and then progress into a detailed ones. These will eventually lead to low fidelity wireframe and&nbsp;wireflows.</p><h3>Questions</h3><p>For each user flow, the questions you need to consider&nbsp;is:</p><ul><li>What is the user trying to&nbsp;accomplish?</li><li>What is important to the user and what will give them confidence to&nbsp;continue?</li><li>What additional information will the user need to complete the&nbsp;task?</li><li>What are the user&rsquo;s hesitations or barriers to accomplish the&nbsp;task?</li></ul><p>The answers to these questions should give an idea of how to best help the user complete the task they are set out to&nbsp;achieve.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>User flows often consists of boxes and arrows and they illustrate the steps or stages a user takes through a given set or&nbsp;objective.</p><h4>High level user&nbsp;flows</h4><p>During the incubation of the initial idea, high-level user flows are used in order to have an easy overview of each stage of the user&rsquo;s process without digging too much into the&nbsp;details.</p><p>These generally follows the primary user story or <a class="external" href="https://medium.muz.li/red-routes-critical-design-paths-that-make-or-break-your-app-a642ebe0940a" target="_blank">red route</a> and should be based on a user&nbsp;persona.</p><figure><img src="../m/user-flows.jpg" alt="User Flow" loading="lazy"></figure><p>It can contain several steps, or pages, but should be kept as simple as possible to quickly give a high-level idea of the flow. The first and last steps are illustrated with a circle, and each step in between with a&nbsp;rectangle.</p><p>Each step also lists goals and thoughts a given user might have on a given&nbsp;page.</p></main><aside>
