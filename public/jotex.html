The company was founded 1963 and is now a part of the larger Ellos Group&nbsp;organization.</em></p><p>A service where well-regarded people can review restaurant dishes in key cities across the&nbsp;globe.</p><p>The project has been in the planning stage since late 2019, but is currently on hiatus due to lack of time from all involved&nbsp;parties.</p><p>When working for Jotex, one of my tasks was to help the team create marketing e-mails on a weekly basis. A large chunk of the process from idea to finalized mail required manual work, and to speed this process up I created an application that would automate the majority of that work for me and my&nbsp;co-workers.</p><h2>Issue</h2><p>Jotex had its product catalog translated to several different markets. This meant that when an employee created a campaign for all those markets, they had to go to each website and copy the product names, prices and labels and paste that data into Photoshop to create a&nbsp;mockup.</p><p>The mockup was then printed out and presented to the marketing director for approval. Upon approval, the employee would move on to create the actual e-mail (following the mockup design) in the marketing&nbsp;application.</p><p>Depending on how large the campaign was (which often correlated with the number of products), it was fairly common that it took the employee atleast 8 hours to to have a mockup for&nbsp;presentation.</p><h2>Automation</h2><p>By utilizing the product SKUs we were able to crawl the website in all different languages, automatically fetch the necessary data and present them in an interface where the employee could copy and paste to the marketing application with the click of a&nbsp;button.</p><p>Product images were stitched together with the appropriate labels in all languages and thumbnails with correct size were generated and named following the internal naming conventions for download so that they quickly could be uploaded to the marketing&nbsp;application.</p><p>The employee was automatically notified when a product ran out of stock and needed to be switched out. When that happened, one could enter a new product SKU and the application would crawl the data again and generate the appropriate&nbsp;data.</p><p>A lot of the redundant work the employees did was no longer needed, which allowed for creation of marketing mails to be more&nbsp;effective.</p></main><aside>
