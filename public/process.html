One of the key principles of lean thinking is that the aim is to alwaus move from doubt to&nbsp;certainty.</p><p>Between us and the end state of perfection (which isn&rsquo;t attainable) there is a fog and we are only able to see two or three steps into that&nbsp;fog.</p><p>To mitigate the risk of running in the wrong direction we take small steps, which equals small risks. We test our hypotheses by running experiments and if the results from such experiements come back and confirm our hypotheses, we continue in that direction. If they don&rsquo;t, we roll back or we pick a different&nbsp;direction.</p><h2>Lean and design&nbsp;thinking</h2><p><a href="design_thinking.html">Design thinking</a> is the <em>learn</em> part of <em>build - measure - learn</em> loop of lean thinking. When we attempt to make it collaborate nicely with agile we run a high risk of <a class="external" href="https://uxdesign.cc/agile-and-design-the-mystery-continues-f363d6b36248" target="_blank">frankensteining</a> our&nbsp;product.</p><blockquote><p class="q">Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer&rsquo;s toolbox to integrate the needs of the people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business&nbsp;success<p class="a">&mdash; Tim Brown, <cite>IDEO</cite></blockquote><p>Instead, look at the principles behind each process in order to make them work in unison and effectively complement&nbsp;eachother.</p><h2>Principles</h2><h3>Customer value equals business&nbsp;value</h3><p>If you make the customer successul, respect their time and create delightful experiences they will reward you. Gain a user-centered perspective by listening to the&nbsp;users.</p><h3>Work in short&nbsp;cycles</h3><p>When we ask our team to predict the future, we ask them to make their best guess in terms of cost, result and outcome. This is a risky way to manage our product. We want to make fact-based decisions, because they overrule the heirarchy. If the evidence disagrees with my opinion, it should overrule it. At each decision point, ask yourself what the next important thing we need to learn is. After that has been identified, ask yourself what the least amount of work we need to do to learn that&nbsp;thing.</p><h3>Hold regular&nbsp;retrospectives.</h3><p>At the end of every cycle, pause and reflect. What worked and didn&rsquo;t work with the product and the process. This promotes&nbsp;agility.</p><h3>Go and&nbsp;see.</h3><p>Walk around the teams and find the patterns, the techniques, the tools that are working. Then amplify those patterns, regardless if they are lean, agile or design&nbsp;thinking.</p><h3>Test your high risk&nbsp;hypotheses.</h3><p>Hypotheses forces us to tell ourselves stories that we believe before we actually tell our customers. Hypotheses that have a high perceived value and is also high risk should be tested first. These are MVPs and&nbsp;experiments.</p><h3>Do less, more&nbsp;often</h3><p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean we don&rsquo;t do all the things we want to do, but rather that we take smaller cycles and we do them more frequently. We ask ourselves what is the fastest way we can learn the most important thing, and then we do that specific&nbsp;thing.</p><h3>Work as a balanced&nbsp;team.</h3><p>Gather people from different departments and create small dedicated self-sufficient teams that are empowered to make decisions based on short cycles, to reduce the risk ad test things. If we&rsquo;re wrong it hurts less, but if we&rsquo;re right we make monumental&nbsp;progress.</p><h3>Radical&nbsp;transparency.</h3><p>Transparency builds trust, alignment and vision, shared understanding which is needed to move forward. Standups or demo days are fantastic methods of driving transparency within teams. Proactive e-mails or access to customers is another way. Customers will tell you what aspects of your product is viable, and they keep you from doing stupid things. Everyone should be able to have access to analytics&nbsp;data.</p><h3>Make learning a first class citizen of your&nbsp;backlog</h3><p>Only have one backlog and make sure everything is handled by all involved&nbsp;people.</p><h2>Team&nbsp;structure</h2><p>Create small teams. If you can&rsquo;t feed your team with two pizzas, the team is too big. Six to eight people, where you know who every body is and you know who to go to in case you need something. This provides amazing&nbsp;accountability.</p><p>Co-locate these people. Put them together so that they are sitting next to eachother, so that they can talk to eachother and can reduce the feedback loop from each other as quickly as&nbsp;possible.</p><p>Make sure everyone is working on one project specifically. Keep context switching to a&nbsp;minimum.</p><p>The team should be able to do whatever it needs to do. If code needs to be written, they should be able to do that. Design? That too. Research? Equally important. The competency to assist in these fields needs to be present within the team so that the team can act quickly on incoming&nbsp;feedback.</p><h3>How to task your&nbsp;team</h3><p>Give them a problem to solve, not a solution to implement. Give the team some structure and let them figure out how to achieve the&nbsp;outcome.</p><h3>Process&nbsp;anti-patterns</h3><p>Avoid team structures which doesn&rsquo;t promote cross-functional&nbsp;collaboration.</p><p>Do not fixiate on job titles. They are stupid and doesn&rsquo;t represent the knowledge of the individual. Let people contribute in whatever way that they can in the beginning of a&nbsp;project.</p><p>Have no fear of failure. Let&rsquo;s fail early and&nbsp;adapt.</p></main><aside>
