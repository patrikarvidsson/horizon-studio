A mental model is <strong>what the user believes</strong> about the system at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>It is built into a user&rsquo;s brain and referenced in order to make sense of a website or application. When referring to what we know about past interactions, we can navigation new interactions&nbsp;easier.</p><p>We should aim to decrease the friction between <strong>what the user believes</strong> and <strong>how we design a product</strong>. Users base their prediction about the system on their mental models, and if their mental model differ from that of the designer a gap is created which means bad usability for that&nbsp;user.</p><p>If the interaction uses the same patterns and <a href="information_architecture.html">information architecture</a> of a similar service, users are more comfortable using your&nbsp;service.</p><h2>Designers&nbsp;dilemma</h2><p>Designers know too much about design, and therefore form wonderful mental models of their own creations. The mental model of a user is often much more deficient in comparison and this makes it more likely for people to make mistakes or find the design to be difficult to&nbsp;use.</p><p>In order to create design that works in the real world you have to understand the users&rsquo; mental model. This is why we want to validate our hypotheses with actual user&nbsp;research.</p><h2>Innovation</h2><p>Interactions that people know usually sticks, even when it&rsquo;s not particularly helpful. <a href="jacobs_law.html">Jacob&rsquo;s law</a> tells us that users spend most of their time on websites <em>other</em> than yours so they expect websites and applications to behave&nbsp;similarly.</p><p>We shouldn&rsquo;t stay away from innovation though. We just need to be very clear that whatever innovation we introduce is vastly superior to the alternatives. One misconception could cause users to systematically misinterpret everything that happens on a&nbsp;website.</p><p>It is important to create a reality where we can iterate and test our innovation quickly and effectively with real users. This is <a href="process.html">lean thinking</a> in a&nbsp;nutshell.</p><h2>Solving mental model&nbsp;issues</h2><p>When a user makes mistake on a website, it is often because they&rsquo;ve formed an erroneous mental model. At this point we want to talk with our users to understand what the root cause of the friction&nbsp;is.</p><p>The <a href="thinking_aloud.html">thinking aloud</a> method is effective because it gives us insights into a user&rsquo;s mental model. When a user verbalizes what they think, believe, behave, and predict during user testing you can piece together much of their mental&nbsp;model.</p><p>We can then either change our system to comply with the users&rsquo; mental model by methods such as <a href="card_sorting.html">card sorting</a> (which is handy when working with navigations), or we can improve the users&rsquo; mental model to reflect our&nbsp;system.</p><p>The latter is done by guiding the user and further explaining each step of the way in the interface. Ideally this is something you should do anyway, but at some point too much information is a bandage-solution used to solve the wrong&nbsp;problem.</p><p>When performing a competitive analysis we know perform well, we get a lot of interesting data for&nbsp;free.</p></main>
