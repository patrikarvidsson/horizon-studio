We test our hypotheses by running experiments and if the results from such experiements come back and confirm our hypotheses, we continue in that direction. If they don&rsquo;t, we roll back or we pick a different&nbsp;direction.</p><p>The conceptual creation process functions as a universal language between parties who who lacks knowledge of design, and aids in the interpretation of an&nbsp;idea.</p><h3>Design&nbsp;thinking</h3><p><a href="design_thinking.html">Design thinking</a> is the <em>learn</em> part of <em>build - measure - learn</em> loop of lean thinking. When we attempt to make it collaborate nicely with agile we run a high risk of <a class="external" href="https://uxdesign.cc/agile-and-design-the-mystery-continues-f363d6b36248" target="_blank">frankensteining</a> our&nbsp;product.</p><blockquote><p class="q">Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer&rsquo;s toolbox to integrate the needs of the people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business&nbsp;success<p class="a">&mdash; Tim Brown, <cite>IDEO</cite></blockquote><p>Instead we should look at the principles behind each process in order to make them work in unison and effectively complement&nbsp;eachother.</p><h3>The lifecycle of a&nbsp;concept</h3><p>In order to work efficiently and mitigate lost time at all cost we must start small. We quickly sketch out our ideas on paper because as we see our ideas taking form our brain starts to build connections which help us validate whether our idea is working or not. This is why at this stage we should never experiment with color, as that often causes confusion with stakeholders and other key people in a&nbsp;project.</p><p>We start our with raw, napkin-like, sketches that paints a picture of the rough lines that frames the&nbsp;concept.</p><figure><img src="../m/process2.jpg" alt="Concept lifecycle" loading="lazy"></figure><p>When we see that something doesn&rsquo;t work out, this process allows us to zoom out and revise our idea before we dive too deep into the details. When we are on the right track we progress through the generations where the concepts are refined and more details are added in&nbsp;iterations.</p><p>If we at some point need to divert from the original concept and branch out to a new concept we start again in the beginning and progress from there. When this happen we make a note about what works and what didn&rsquo;t work, to make sure we learn from the situation and make better decisions in the&nbsp;future.</p><h3>Principles</h3><h4>Customer value equals business&nbsp;value</h4><p>If we make the customer successful, respect their time and create delightful experiences they will reward us. We can obtain a user-centered perspective by listening to our&nbsp;users.</p><h4>Work in short&nbsp;cycles</h4><p>When we ask our team to predict the future, we ask them to make their best guess in terms of cost, result and outcome. This is a risky way to manage our product. We want to make fact-based decisions, because they overrule the heirarchy. If the evidence disagrees with our opinion, it should overrule&nbsp;it.</p><p>At each decision point, we need to ask ourselves what the next important thing we need to learn is. After that has been identified, we shoudl ask ourselves what the least amount of work we need to do is to learn that&nbsp;thing.</p><h4>Retrospection</h4><p>At the end of every cycle, pause and reflect. What worked and didn&rsquo;t work with the product and the process? This promotes&nbsp;agility.</p><h4>Watch and&nbsp;learn</h4><p>Walk around the teams and learn about patterns, techniques and tools that are working. Amplify these patterns, regardless if they are lean, agile or design&nbsp;thinking.</p><h4>Test high risk&nbsp;hypotheses</h4><p>Hypotheses forces us to tell stories which we believe before we actually tell our customers. Hypotheses that have a high perceived value and is also high risk should be tested first. These are MVPs and&nbsp;experiments.</p><h4>Do less, more&nbsp;often</h4><p>Take smaller cycles and and do more experiements more frequently. We ask ourselves what is the fastest way we can learn the most important thing, and then we do that specific&nbsp;thing.</p><h4>Work as a balanced&nbsp;team</h4><p>Gather people from different departments and create small dedicated self-sufficient teams that are empowered to make decisions in short cycles, in an effort to reduce risk and test things efficiently. If we&rsquo;re wrong it hurts less, but if we&rsquo;re right we make monumental&nbsp;progress.</p><h4>Radical&nbsp;transparency</h4><p>Transparency builds trust, alignment with vision and shared understanding which is needed to move forward. Stand-ups or demo days are fantastic methods of driving transparency within teams. Proactive e-mails or access to customers is another way. Customers will tell you what aspects of your product is viable, and they keep you from doing stupid things. Everyone should be able to have access to analytics&nbsp;data.</p><h4>Make learning a first class citizen of your&nbsp;backlog</h4><p>Only have one backlog and make sure everything is handled by all involved&nbsp;parties.</p><h3>Team&nbsp;structure</h3><p>Create small teams. If you can&rsquo;t feed your team with two pizzas, the team is too big. Six to eight people, where you know who everyone is and you know who to go to in case you need something is ideal. This provides amazing&nbsp;accountability.</p><p>Co-locate these people. Put them next to eachother so that they can talk to eachother and can reduce the feedback loop from each other as quickly as&nbsp;possible.</p><p>Make sure everyone is working on one project specifically. Keep context switching to a&nbsp;minimum.</p><p>The team should be able to do whatever it needs to do. If code needs to be written, they should be able to do that. Design? That too. Research? Equally important. The ability to assist in these fields needs to be present within the team so that the team can act quickly on incoming&nbsp;feedback.</p><h4>How to task your&nbsp;team</h4><p>Give them a problem to solve, not a solution to implement. Give the team some structure and let them figure out how to achieve the&nbsp;outcome.</p><h4>Process&nbsp;anti-patterns</h4><p>Avoid team structures which doesn&rsquo;t promote cross-functional&nbsp;collaboration.</p><p>Do not fixiate on job titles. They are stupid and doesn&rsquo;t represent the knowledge of the individual. Let people contribute in whatever way that they can in the beginning of a&nbsp;project.</p><p>Have no fear of failure. Fail early and&nbsp;adapt.</p></main>
