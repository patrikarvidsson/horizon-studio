An experience where the user is guided onto the next step without being overwhelmed with&nbsp;information.</p><p>Anything that a user considers to be a waste of time will feel as if it requires significantly more effort compared to something they feel is necessary. Every input field of interaction should therefor have a real purpose. This should have a higher priority than, for example, visual&nbsp;aesthetics.</p><p>If a feature has very little utility in a technical sense, it could still be worthwhile to keep if it positively affect the experience for the end&nbsp;user.</p><p>Remember that great functionality remain useless if people don&rsquo;t know how to use it&nbsp;properly.</p><h3>Don&rsquo;t make me&nbsp;think</h3><p>Each time we ask a user to generate some kind of content, they are forced to think twice about it. A designer should always consider whether this adds long term value to the user or not. Futhermore, every choice is another decision the user has to make so it is equally important to consider how easy it is for the user to make that&nbsp;choice.</p><p>If there is one part of your experience that is particularly frustrating or requires a lot of effort, it&rsquo;s likely that people will remember it even if the rest of the experience was&nbsp;great.</p><blockquote><p class="q">People will anticipate regret if they start to feel like the benefits of completing a process don&rsquo;t outweigh any potential negative reaction. This happens even if their concerns are&nbsp;irrational.<p class="a">&mdash; Peter Ramsey, <cite>Built for&nbsp;Mars</cite></blockquote><h3>Continous&nbsp;feedback</h3><p>Error messages should be as specific as possible because generic ones can cause an increase in required effort by sending users round and round in&nbsp;circles.</p><p>You should be pro-active about telling your user bad news. The quick response will be appreciated and it will help build a positive relationship with your users. What is the worst thing that can happen? We should prepare for&nbsp;that.</p><p>Feedback from any type of input should also be as quick as&nbsp;possible.</p><h3>Patterns in&nbsp;interaction</h3><p>Never put opposite, or unrelated, actions in the same place on different screens. If a user associate the top right corner as an area to log out it makes little sense having the continue button there on the next screen. As humans we are very good at sub-consciously notice patterns and predicting what will happen next, and going against this causes increased friction which requires more effort from the&nbsp;user.</p><p>Use icons, images and formatting to help people navigate our product quickly. Even simple items like drop downs require energy and attention to&nbsp;complete.</p><h3>Effortlessness</h3><p>When building a digital queue, you need to make it possible for the user to track their progress, and estimate a completion time. If in doubt, copy&nbsp;Disneyland.</p><p>People generally like finding stuff how they left it — and this is also true for apps. Unless a significant amount of time has passed apps should let a user continue from where they left&nbsp;off.</p><h3>Ownership</h3><p>Try and give your users the feeling of progress and ownership as early as possible. It will keep people more invested in your&nbsp;product.</p><nav><ol><li><a href="design_methods.html">Methods</a><li><a href="design_theory.html">Theory</a></ol></nav></main>
